Imagine that you are in a market which only trades one type of item (e.g. tomatoes of equal quality; generally known as "shares"). There will be a certain amount of tomatoes (shares) being offered at certain prices. Also, there will be people willing to buy at a certain price. Imagine that everyone who could buy/sell at an acceptable price(limit price) immediately does that and leaves the market. This way (most of the time), nobody can perform a trade right now and everyone has to wait until something changes (e.g. someone reconsiders "acceptable" price, or a new person appears). Those "limit orders" (people willing to buy/sell in certain quantities) are the limit order book. In some cases people are willing to buy/sell at any price (that's called a "market order"), such a person is always going to perform the trade and then leaves the market.

In other words, each price level (for simplicity let's think of it as an integer value) can be either bid (there are people willing to buy at this price), ask (people are willing to sell at this price) or spread (nobody is willing to buy or sell at this price).

The best bid is always lower than the best ask. (for this task it's not important why it is so, but otherwise, those limit orders would execute. We do not ask you to implement this behavior in your solution).
